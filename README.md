[Risk Probability Solver](http://smacke.net/risk_solver/)
=========================================================

Javascript and Python versions of a simple algorithm to compute probabilities
for the board game "Risk". Given a starting army, a sequence of armies to
attack, and the desired minimum number of game pieces to leave behind at each
conquered territory, the algorithm computes the probability of success. See
[here](http://smacke.net/risk_solver/) for example use.
